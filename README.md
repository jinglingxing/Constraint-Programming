# Constraint-Programming
## TP1 problem:
TP1 is a match schedule problem wrote by Minizinc language. What I need to do is to is safisfied several strict constraints for given instances and found solutions and tested results at different consistency level and compared two significant models performances, such as failures, search tree, runtime.

The dataset including 15 instances, I tested them using bound and domain consistency levels and compared the runing time, failures and search tree(nodes). Detailed info: [Report](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Constraint-Programming/blob/master/TP1_Minizinc/constraint-programming-tp1.pdf)

I wrote two models: one is normal method. Detailed info: [Model 1](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Constraint-Programming/blob/master/TP1_Minizinc/TP1_INF6101_1.mzn)

one is based on DFA(deterministic finite automaton). Detailed info:[Model 2](https://github.com/jinglingxing/Constraint-Programming/blob/master/TP1_Minizinc/TP1_INF6101_2.mzn)
